Course project for Getting and Cleaning Data

## The script run_analysis.R performs the following:
### 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
### 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
### 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
### 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
### 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

## In your current directory, you should have 2 sub-directories: test and train
### test contains test data; train contains training data
### each directory in turns contains 3 text files: subject_xxx.txt, y_xxx.txt, X_xxx.txt where xxx is either test or train.
